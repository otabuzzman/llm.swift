# llm.swift

A Swift port of Andrej Karpathyâ€˜s [llm.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c). 

## Quick start
- Clone [llm.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c), checkout commit [2346cdac](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/tree/2346cdac931f544d63ce816f7e3f5479a917eef5) (`git checkout 2346cdac`) this port is based on, and follow instructions given there in section [quick start (CPU)](https://github.com/otabuzzman/llm.c/blob/2346cdac931f544d63ce816f7e3f5479a917eef5/README.md#quick-start-cpu). This will get you the dataset, the tokens, the small GPT-2 model (124M) released by OpenAI, and two executables for testing and training.

- Clone this repository, cd into it, build and run the executables for testing and training. 

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/otabuzzman/llm.swift.git
  cd llm.swift
  
  xcodebuild # will build for production
  # create sym-links for convenience
  ln -s build/Release/llm.swift test_gpt2
  ln -s build/Release/llm.swift train_gpt2
  
  # usage:
  # test_gpt2 [ <llm.c folder> ]
  # train_gpt2 [ <llm.c folder> ]
  
  ./test_gpt2 ../llm.c   # llm.c data in sibling folder
  ./train_gpt2 ../llm.c
  ```

### Performance notes
Swift porting done one-to-one with existing parallelization tools is slower than C and probably worth further investigation (preliminary conclusion).

The sequential (`NO_OMP=1`) code from the C compiler runs roughly 3 times faster than the code produced by the Swift compiler (20/ 60 seconds), measured in step duration of `test_gpt2` on a Macbook Air (2015) (Intel, 4 cores, 8 GB).

Parallelization with OpenMP (`NO_OMP=0`) in C and built-in _Structured Concurrency_ in Swift (using `withTaskGroup`) cuts down execution times to a half on both sides (10/ 30 seconds).

Regarding Swift, almost all of the performance gain came from parallelizing `matmul_forward`. The contribution of parallelization of the remaining functions that use OpenMP in C was marginal.

Parallelization of `matmul_backward` was strange as it lengthens execution time (40 seconds); thus left out `matmul_backword` parallelization for later investigation.

Using the _Grand Central Dispatch_ API `concurrentPerform` instead of `withTaskGroup` for any function that uses OpenMP on the C side yields an execution time on 25 seconds. 

Execution times of setups with notable impact:

|#|Setup|Time (seconds)|
|---:|:---|---:|
|1|C, `-march=native`, OpenMP|10|
|2|C, `-march=native`, no OpenMP|20|
|3|C, no `-march=native`, OpenMP|15|
|4|C, no `-march=native`, no OpenMP|25|
|5|Swift, `-march=native`, `matmul_backward`|50|
|6|Swift, `-march=native`, no `matmul_backward`|30|
|7|Swift, `-march=native`, GCD|25|
